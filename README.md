<h1>
React hooks lifecycle
</h1>


**[View the interactive diagram here](https://wavez.github.io/react-hooks-lifecycle/)**  

I made this diagram following [Dan Abramov's tweet](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/981712092611989509) (and the latter [diagram](http://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-lifecycle-methods-diagram/)) about the lifecycle of the now "old" class components.
I wanted to have a diagram exactly like that but for react 16.8.x hooks - so I kept the style for familiraty.  

The diagram is made using [draw.io](https://draw.io) and is easily editable through its GUI
